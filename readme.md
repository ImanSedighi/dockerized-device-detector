## Plista Test
Hey there, Here is a simple dockerized application to detect user's browser.

## How to run
- Install composer packages in the app directory.
- Run docker-compose up 
- Open the app in http://localhost:8080/

## Application
Use PHP + Javascript to build a web-based device detector which can classify the user's device. Create a front-end that enables the user to start the detection and outputs the result. The detector should be able to classify the device in terms of its type (tablet, phone, desktop) and its operating system. Don't reinvent the wheel but use an existing open-source project for device detection. The application should use a micro-service architecture and run as a containerized environment. Along with the code please submit tests.
